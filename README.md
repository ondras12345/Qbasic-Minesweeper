# Qbasic-Minesweeper
Qbasic console implementation of the Minesweeper game. Also works with [QB64](http://www.qb64.net/)

For QB64 support, please search for a line containing `Comment out this line for QB64 support:` and comment out the next line by typing a single quote (') in front of it. This disables stopwatch and time functionality which caused problems.

For some reason it currently doesn't work with QB64 on Linux (probably key event trapping), but it works OK with Windows.

I developed this program under MS-DOS Version 6.22 with Qbasic (in 2019) and transfered it on a 3.5" floppy to a Linux computer from which I commit.
